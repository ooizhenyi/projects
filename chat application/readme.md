 a simple chat application using java with the requirement:

1.Design the user interface: You will need to create a user interface that allows users to create accounts, login, and chat with other users. This can be a web interface or a desktop application, depending on your preference.

2.Create a server: You will need to create a server that will handle all the communication between users. The server will need to listen for incoming connections, manage user accounts, and send messages between users.

3.Create a client: You will need to create a client application that users can install on their devices. The client will need to connect to the server and allow users to create accounts, login, and send messages to other users.

4.Implement user authentication: You will need to implement a secure authentication system that allows users to create accounts and login to the chat application. You can use a username and password system or a more advanced authentication mechanism like OAuth.

5.Implement real-time messaging: You will need to implement real-time messaging between users. This can be done using Java sockets and multithreading. You will need to ensure that messages are delivered quickly and reliably.

6.Implement user status: You can implement a user status feature that allows users to see when other users are online or offline. This can be done using a simple status indicator next to each user's name.
