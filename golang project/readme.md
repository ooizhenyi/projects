 ideas to enhance web scraper built with Golang and Colly:

Scrape multiple pages: To scrape multiple pages, you can use Colly's Visit() method to visit each page in a loop. You can also use Colly's OnResponse() method to check the HTTP status code and handle errors.

Extract more data: You can modify the code to extract more data from the website. For example, you can scrape product names, descriptions, prices, and images from an e-commerce website.

Implement rate limiting: To avoid getting banned by the website, you can implement rate limiting by using Colly's SetRequestDelay() method to set a delay between requests.

Use proxies: To avoid IP blocking, you can use proxies by setting the ProxyURL field in Colly's Request() method.

Save data to a file or database: To save the scraped data, you can write it to a file or database. For example, you can use the os package to create a CSV file and write the data to it.

Implement authentication: If the website requires authentication, you can use Colly's Post() method to submit login credentials and authenticate the scraper.

Use a headless browser: If the website requires JavaScript to render the content, you can use a headless browser like Puppeteer or Selenium to scrape the website.
